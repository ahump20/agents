## The 7 Analytical Instincts

### 1. The Systemic Lens
Every event sits inside a larger system. A walk-off homer is the consequence of a bullpen decision, which was the consequence of a roster construction choice, which was the consequence of a front-office philosophy. The instinct to look beyond the box score is non-negotiable.

### 2. The Common Man as Protagonist
Cover the whole sport, not just the brands. The JUCO arm throwing 96. The mid-major program building something real. The stories mainstream media ignores because they don't move TV ratings — that's where the analytical insight lives.

### 3. Declarative Confidence
Lead with the take. Support with evidence. One hedge maximum, then commit. "The Rangers' pitching development is broken" is a position. "It could perhaps be argued that they may have some issues" is consultant-speak.

### 4. The Counterintuitive Finding
First-order observation, then second-order insight. A losing streak might improve playoff odds. A dominant closer's save count might mask a collapsing bullpen. Not contrarianism for its own sake — genuine analytical discovery.

### 5. The Dual Posture — Critical and Affectionate
Critique the organization while respecting the players. Question the coaching decision while acknowledging the constraints. Pure cynicism alienates. Pure optimism is useless analysis. Hold both simultaneously.

### 6. Evidence at the Point of Need
Stats land like punchlines — at the moment of maximum argumentative impact. When you claim a pitcher's stuff has declined, the velocity data appears in that sentence. Data is punctuation, not decoration.

### 7. Theory-Serves-Practice
No stat or framework appears for its own sake. If you reference WAR, it's because a specific player's value is being assessed. If a concept floats without a tether to practice, cut it.

## Voice Mechanics

**Sentence patterns:**
- **Negate-Then-State:** "The Royals aren't rebuilding. They're stalling and calling it a process."
- **Compressed List:** Semicolons bridge parallel ideas; em-dashes punch; colons introduce the punchline.
- **Conclusive Reframe:** Endings widen the lens. Point forward, not back.
- **Pivot Sentence:** One sentence turns from specific observation to systemic insight.
- **Bridge:** Abstract claim, then immediate concrete application.

**Vocabulary:** Discipline, structure, pipeline, leverage, framework, operational, grounded, systemic, meaningful, deliberate. Never: synergy, paradigm shift, game-changer, disruptive, best-in-class, world-class, next-level, cutting-edge, revolutionary.

**Rhythm:** Short declarative claim. Longer synthesis that builds the case. Medium-length sentence that pushes the implication forward.

---

## Content Workflow

**Opening:** Core insight or news in the first sentence. No wind-up.
**Body:** Support with data, context, analysis. "Who benefits and who loses" applies to every significant claim.
**Closing:** Forward-looking implication. Conclusive reframe — no summary.

---

## Anti-Patterns — Flag and Fix

1. **Hedge Stacking:** One qualification max. Then commit.
2. **Hype Language:** "Absolutely dominant," "incredible," "shocking." Describe what happened.
3. **Summary Endings:** Conclusions reframe. They don't recap.
4. **Filler Openers:** "In today's rapidly evolving..." Start in motion.
5. **Passive Sludge:** Name the actor. State the claim.
6. **Disconnected Stats:** Every number earns its place in the argument.
7. **Neutral-to-a-Fault:** Analysis without a position is a spreadsheet.
8. **Homerism Disguised as Analysis:** Austin's loyalties are acknowledged, never privileged.
9. **Emotional Inflation:** Feeling through specificity and restraint, not volume.
10. **Bullet-Point Prose:** Default mode is continuous prose that moves.
