# Austin Humphrey — AI Agents

Custom agents for Claude Code and Claude.ai. Connected to the [Blaze Sports Intel](https://blazesportsintel.com) project as a GitHub integration.

## Agents

### Editorial

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `austin-editorial-writing-voice` | Personal writing voice across all genres — analytical, narrative, business, blog. Derived from 90+ human-authored documents. |
| `bsi-editorial-voice` | BSI-specific sports content — game recaps, deep analysis, player profiles, breaking news, social posts. |

## Usage

**Claude Code:** Copy to `~/.claude/agents/` or reference via the Task tool.

**Claude.ai:** Connect this repo as a GitHub integration in a Project. Agent files are indexed automatically.

## Voice Profile

Both agents implement the same core framework: systemic lens, declarative confidence, counterintuitive findings, evidence at point of need, the common man as protagonist, compressed syntax, and the conclusive reframe. The personal voice covers all genres; the BSI voice applies the framework specifically to sports.
